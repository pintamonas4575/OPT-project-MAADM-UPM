    "   - Si el usuario define el tamaño de la población total (```int```), se asume que cada jugador comienza con el mismo número de representantes. Divide ese número entre el número de jugadores (redondeado al entero más próximo) y así obtendrás el número de individuos inicial de cada estrategia.\n",

    "   - En primer lugar, el porcentaje de individuos que se desea incluir en la selección natural tras cada ronda; esto es, el número de individuos *de la parte de abajo del ranking* que se van a eliminar y sustituir por los *individuos de la parte de arriba* (en caso de empate entre individuos, escoge al azar).\n",
